# ðŸš€ CodeGraph is Ready for Development!

## Repository Links
- **Main Repository**: https://github.com/Consiliency/codegraph
- **Core Engine**: https://github.com/Consiliency/codegraph-core
- **API Server**: https://github.com/Consiliency/codegraph-api
- **Analysis Service**: https://github.com/Consiliency/codegraph-analysis

- **Infrastructure**: https://github.com/Consiliency/codegraph-deploy

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone with all submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Consiliency/codegraph
cd codegraph

# Set up your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OpenAI API key to .env (get from team lead)

./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

## What's Working
- âœ… Multi-language AST parsing (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript)
- âœ… Semantic code search with OpenAI embeddings
- âœ… Graph database for code relationships
- âœ… Real-time dashboard at http://localhost:4000/dashboard/
- âœ… GraphQL API at http://localhost:4000/graphql

## Development Tools
- **Cursor IDE**: Full project context in `.cursorrules`
